Project Description
===================

Background
----------
* ELT
* Star formation
* Universal in all environments?
* Constant over time / outside the Milky Way?
* High-z galaxies
* What is different to today's galaxies

Tools
-----
* Illustris
   * What is Illustris?
   * Why is this interesting to use?
* SimCADO
   * What is SimCADO?
   * What can SimCADO deliver?

Questions
---------
* Using SmCADO to observe galaxies generated by Illustris
   * Why? - To determine the observational limits of key observational quantities?
   * Why? -
      * Because time on the ELT (TMT etc) will be very expensive
      * Because we want to find out which fundamental questions the ELT will help us answer
* What properties of the illustris galaxies do we want to look at?
   * Star formation rate
   * Star formation distribution at different z
   * General galaxy structure in high-z galaxies
   * Consequences of Interactions between galaxies at high-z

Success Criteria
----------------
* We have a pipeline which
   * queries Illustris galaxies
   * downloads particle information that belong to the galaxies
   * projects the galaxies in any orientation
      * also determines which
